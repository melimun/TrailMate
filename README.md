# TrailMate
Final project for Mobile Web App Development.
This is a demonstrated demo and still has functionalities that do not work.

# What is TrailMate?
Trailmate is an application that combines a hikerâ€™s personal agenda and their trail experience through an interactable map interface. Our motivation is to make hiking fun and accessible for newer hikers who are unfamiliar with an area through the help of community pins. This tackles a problem we have witnessed in the hiking application marketplace, which is a lack of community involvement. Taking inspiration from similar apps such as iNaturalist or AllTrails, we will take features that make these applications work so well, and build upon it.  Aside from making hiking engaging to outdoor enthusiasts, businesses are able to utilise this application through tourism companies such as those that provide guided hiking tours.
